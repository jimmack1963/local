  "intro_function": "We help you record books for your loved ones, however they may be behaving currently.      This version used DropBox to store images and recordings. Specifically, it uses <em>your</em> DropBox account, making a folder called \\Apps\\PlayItAgainKid. It\"s your own disk in the cloud, easy to copy anywhere. This means you always will have your originals, and that we never even see anything you create.",
  "whole_idea": "<div><p> So, the next time you’re reading a favorite book to your child, you grab your cell phone and go to <b>Play It Again Kid</b>. You can <b>take a selfie of both of you, plus the book</b>. Then <b>record your reading</b>, page by page. </p><p> Now this can be <b>played back</b> on a tablet, phone or PC, any time they wish just by clicking on that selfie. It can play <b>straight through, or page by page</b> while the babysitter interacts over the illustrations. After your child plays it,<b> you can get an email</b> so you know they spent some time with your recording, and they can press a button to <b>record a message</b>, a picture of themselves, or a drawing by them, which is <b>sent to you</b> and <b>saved for posterity</b>. Maybe they wake up from a noise at night, and turn to the recording to <b>comfort themselves back to sleep</b> – now you’ll know. </p><p> And if they are learning to read, they can play it back word by word and <b>learn to sight read to your voice</b>, at their own speed. </p><p> On any page they want, you can prompt them to <b>draw what is happening</b>, retell you the story, or <b>take a picture of them</b> acting that page out in real life. <b>All saved permanently</b> so you can see their progress as they develop. Before you know it, your child’s favorite literature has become <b>a rich multi-media creative interaction</b> - fun to watch their own version of the book, saved for them to play to other family members. </p></div>",
