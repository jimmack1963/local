Then <b>record your reading</b>, page by page. </p><p> Now this can be <b>played back</b> on a tablet, phone or PC, any time they wish just by clicking on that selfie. It can play <b>straight through, or page by page</b> while the babysitter interacts over the illustrations. After your child plays it,<b> you can get an email</b> so you know they spent some time with your recording, and they can press a button to <b>record a message</b>, a picture of themselves, or a drawing by them, which is <b>sent to you</b> and <b>saved for posterity</b>. Maybe they wake up from a noise at night, and turn to the recording to <b>comfort themselves back to sleep</b> – now you’ll know. </p><p> And if they are learning to read, they can play it back word by word and <b>learn to sight read to your voice</b>, at their own speed. </p><p> On any page they want, you can prompt them to <b>draw what is happening</b>, retell you the story, or <b>take a picture of them</b> acting that page out in real life. <b>All saved permanently</b> so you can see their progress as they develop. Before you know it, your child’s favorite literature has become <b>a rich multi-media creative interaction</b> - fun to watch their own version of the book, saved for them to play to other family members. </p></div>'
