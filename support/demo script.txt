1)  Take a selfie of the book, the child, and yourself.  This selfie will identify the book for replay.
2)  Read each page.  You can also take a picture of each page.  This helps the child match the recording when playing on their own.
3)  Your child can now replay the book at any time, over and over.
4)  Your presence is now available around the clock from anywhere.
5)  Your child can draw their own illustrations, which are saved for the right page.  They can re-draw the images every few months so you can see their progress as they learn to draw.  They can also record their own telling of the stories.
6)  You now have a child drawn, child narrated version of your favorite books, ready for the next generation of little rereaders.
